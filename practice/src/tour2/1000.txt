PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a game of chess, the king is always looking out for his safety, trying to
stay out of the path of the opponent's attacking pieces.  Given an x by y
rectangular chess board, with z opponent pieces placed on the board, determine
how many safe squares are left on the board, where the king may be placed.
Safe squares are squares that are not in the path of attack of one or more
opponent piece(s).

Discription of piece movement:
- A queen's path of attack is any square contained in a horizontal, vertical,
or diagonal line crossing the square on which it stands.
- A rook's path of attack is any square contained in a horizontal or vertical
line crossing the square on which it stands.
- A bishop's path of attack is any square contained in a diagonal line crossing
the square on which it stands.
- A knight's path of attack is the last square of an L shaped movement
(described below) starting from the square it is standing on.
- A pawns path of attack is the first diagonal square in *all four directions*
starting from the square it is standing on.

The following must be true for a valid L shaped movement:
1. Start from the square the knight is standing on. 
2. If the knight moves m square(s) horizontally then it must move n square(s)
vertically
3. If the knight moves m square(s) vertically then it must move n square(s)
horizontally
4. If m equals 1 then n must equal 2
5. If n equals 1 then m must equal 2

The input will be a String[] representing the squares on a rectangular chess
board.  Each square is represented by a character having one of the following
values:
'U' will represent an unoccupied square (there are no pieces located in that
square)
 'Q' will represent a queen in that square
 'R' will represent a rook in that square
 'B' will represent a bishop in that square
 'K' will represent a knight in that square
 'P' will represent a pawn in that square

The following diagrams are meant to show how the pieces can move.  The pieces
are represented as above, 'X' represents a square in the path of attack of the
piece and '+' represents a safe square.

    Queen           Rook         Bishop         Knight          Pawn

Implement a class ChessCover which contains a method getSafe.  getSafe should
return the number of safe squares on the board.

DEFINITION
Class name: ChessCover
Method name: getSafe
Parameters:  String[]
Returns: int
Method signature (be sure your method is public):  int getSafe (String[]
boardLayout);

NOTES
- The king is not on the board.  The purpose is to count the number of
available safe squares on which the king can placed.
- The board may be full, i.e. every square on the board can have a piece on it
(z <= x*y).  
- There are five types of pieces: queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn.  
- The same type of piece may be placed on the board multiple times (i.e. there
may be 5 queens on the board etc.).
- The square on which a piece sits is not a safe square.
- A Piece can block another piece's path of attack.
- A knight is the only piece that can jump over another piece(s).
- A pawn's path of attack differs from regular chess rules.  The pawn path of
attack is the first diagonal square in *all four directions* starting from the
square it is standing on.
- The board is not necessarily square.  The number of rows could be the
different than the number of columns.

TopCoder will ensure the validity of the inputs.  Inputs are valid if all of
the following criteria are met:
- Each element of boardLayout will have a length between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
- Each element of boardLayout will be of equal length.
- Each element of boardLayout will consist of characters from the following
list: 'U', 'Q', 'R', 'B', 'K', 'P'.
- boardLayout will have between 1 and 10 elements, inclusive.

EXAMPLES
U U -> + + -> 4 safe squares
U U    + +

U U U U U    X X X X X
U Q U Q U -> X Q X Q X -> 0 safe squares
U U U U U    X X X X X

U U U    X + X 
U P U -> + P + -> 4 safe squares
U U U    X + X 

U U U U    X + X +
U U U U    X X + +
Q U U U -> Q X X X -> 6 safe squares
U U U U    X X + +

U U U U U Q    X X X X X Q
U U U U U U    + X X X X X
B U R U U U -> B X R X X X -> 6 safe squares
U U K U U U    + X K + + X
U U U U U U    X + X + X X

U B U K U U U B U U -> + B + K + X X B X X -> 4 safe squares
