Problem Statement
    
Given the width and height of a rectangular grid, 
return the total number of rectangles (NOT counting squares) that can be found on this grid.
For example, width = 3, height = 3 (see diagram below):
 __ __ __
|__|__|__|
|__|__|__|
|__|__|__|
In this grid, there are 4 2x3 rectangles, 6 1x3 rectangles and 12 1x2 rectangles. Thus there is a total of 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 rectangles. Note we don't count 1x1, 2x2 and 3x3 rectangles because they are squares.
